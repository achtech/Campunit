You can recognize an unencrypted connection by the fact that the address line of the browser shows "http: //" and no lock symbol is displayed in your browser line. Information that is transmitted over the Internet and content received online can, under certain circumstances, be transmitted via networks of third-party providers. We cannot guarantee the confidentiality of communications or documents that are transmitted via such open networks or third-party networks.

				If you disclose personal information via an open network or third-party networks, you should be aware of the fact that your data will be lost or that third parties may potentially access this information and consequently collect and use the data without your consent. In many cases, the individual data packets are transmitted in encrypted form, but not the names of the sender and recipient. Even if the sender and recipient live in the same country, data is often transmitted via such networks and without controls also via third countries, ie also via countries that do not offer the same level of data protection as your country of domicile. We are not responsible for the security of your data while it is being transmitted over the Internet and decline any liability for direct or indirect losses. We ask you to use other means of communication should you consider this necessary or sensible for security reasons.
				</p>
				<p>
				Despite extensive technical and organizational security precautions, data can possibly be lost or intercepted and / or manipulated by unauthorized persons. As far as possible, we take suitable technical and organizational security measures to prevent this from happening within our system. However, your computer is outside the security area that we can control. As the user, it is your responsibility to find out about the necessary safety precautions and to take suitable measures in this regard. As the website operator, we are in no way liable for any damage you may incur from data loss or manipulation.
